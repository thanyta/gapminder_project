This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")

gap.in %>%
  select(year, pop,country, continent) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(pop))


```
gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
gap.in$pop

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
